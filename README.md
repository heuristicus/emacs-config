# emacs-config
My emacs config files. Put the contents of this repository into `~/.emacs.d` and
everything should work out of the box. You should be able to do this with

    cd
	mkdir .emacs.d
	cd .emacs.d
	git clone git@github.com:heuristicus/emacs-config.git .

Additional packages will be automatically installed from the package archive.

`custom` contains code to specify settings for certain modes or some other settings.
`init.el` is the monster which does all the initialisation
